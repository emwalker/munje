# Munje

Build out your own skill tree.

The vision of Munje is to help you to build out problem solving abilities in specific topic areas (algorithms and data structuers, statistics, chemistry, etc.) by presenting you with progressively more challenging word problems to solve, using spaced repetition to consolidate what you've learned.  As you demonstrate the ability to solve specific key problems over time, harder problems will gradually be shown.

The project is currently pre-MVP.  It is of practical use right now, but only if you click exactly the right things in the right order.
